          Even more information is given in this sentence. Waddaya know, more stuff. The paragraph even discusses the use case for such a technology. 
          More stuff, like this is a place holder so it matters little what I put here. That said, it does to some degree. 
          It has to be atleast cohesive otherwise others may begin to question my wellbeing. 
          I'm fine though, just coming up with more words to place here to reflect a detailed reflection on a project.
